                        <p>Traditional programming involves writing rules, expressed in a programming language, that act on data to produce answers. This approach has been the backbone of software development for decades and applies to almost any scenario where explicit logic can be coded.</p>

                            <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Traditional Programming Use Cases</h4>
                            <p>Traditional programming excels at tasks with clear, rule-based logic such as accounting systems, inventory management, operating systems, and user interfaces. Any scenario where a programmer can articulate exact steps to solve a problem is a good fit for this approach.</p>

                        <p>Machine learning flips the traditional programming paradigm. Instead of writing explicit rules, we provide data and the answers we expect, allowing the computer to figure out what the rules might be. This approach enables systems to learn patterns that would be difficult or impossible to code explicitly.</p>

                        <p>Traditional programming reaches its limits when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The rules are too complex to articulate explicitly</li>
                            <li>The rules change frequently based on new data</li>
                            <li>The problem involves pattern recognition in unstructured data</li>
                            <li>The solution space is too large to explore programmatically</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Machine learning overcomes these limitations by deriving rules from data, making it well-suited for complex pattern recognition tasks like image classification, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.</p>

# 📦 Import required libraries
import torch                    # Core PyTorch library
import torch.nn as nn           # Tools for building neural networks
import torch.optim as optim     # Tools for optimization (e.g., gradient descent)
import numpy as np              # General-purpose numerical operations (optional here)

# 🧠 STEP 1: Build a simple linear model
# What we're doing: telling PyTorch to create a model that learns the relationship between input (x) and output (y).
# We use a neural network with just one neuron, which means it will learn a formula like: y = weight * x + bias

# nn.Linear(1, 1) → means:
#   - 1 input feature (x)
#   - 1 output feature (predicted y)
# The model is wrapped inside nn.Sequential to make it flexible for adding layers in the future
model = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(1, 1))

# 🧪 STEP 2: Define a loss function
# The model makes guesses, and we want to know how far those guesses are from the actual answers.
# We'll use Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure this:
#   MSE = average of (y_actual - y_predicted)^2
# A perfect guess has a loss of 0. Higher loss means the guess was more wrong.
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# 🔧 STEP 3: Define the optimizer
# After knowing how bad the guess is (loss), we want to help the model do better.
# To do that, we adjust the internal values (weight and bias).
# The optimizer does this for us using a method called gradient descent.

# SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) is one of the most common optimizers.
# lr = 0.01 → "learning rate" means we make small changes at a time.
# Large learning rate = faster but risk of overshooting
# Small learning rate = slower but more stable
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# 📊 STEP 4: Prepare training data
# We give the model examples of input (x) and the correct output (y)
# In this case, we are teaching the model a simple pattern: y = 2x + 1

# PyTorch expects input data to be in tensor format.
# Tensors are like flexible versions of arrays, used in deep learning frameworks.
xs = torch.tensor([[-1.0], [0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0], [4.0]], dtype=torch.float32)
ys = torch.tensor([[-3.0], [-1.0], [1.0], [3.0], [5.0], [7.0]], dtype=torch.float32)

# 🔁 STEP 5: Training loop
# Here's where the model learns.
# We go through the training data many times (500 epochs), and each time we:
#   - Let the model make guesses
#   - Measure how wrong those guesses were
#   - Use the error to adjust the internal weight and bias (learning)
for epoch in range(500):

    # 🔄 Step 1: Clear previous gradients
    # Every time we calculate gradients (the direction and amount to adjust), PyTorch adds them up by default.
    # So we need to reset them to 0 before each new learning step.
    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # 🔮 Step 2: Forward pass — make predictions with the current model
    # The model tries to guess the y-values based on its current weight and bias.
    outputs = model(xs)

    # 📏 Step 3: Calculate how wrong the model's guesses are
    # Compare predicted outputs with actual answers and compute the average error.
    loss = criterion(outputs, ys)

    # 🧮 Step 4: Backward pass — compute gradients
    # PyTorch uses calculus to compute how the weight and bias should change to reduce the error.
    # This is called "backpropagation"
    loss.backward()

    # 🔧 Step 5: Update model parameters
    # Now that we have the direction to go (gradients), the optimizer will take a small step in that direction.
    # This updates the weight and bias so the model can guess better next time.
    optimizer.step()

    # 🖨️ (Optional) Print the loss every 25 steps or in the final 10 steps
    # This helps track progress and shows the loss going down
    if epoch % 25 == 0 or epoch >= 490:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch:3d} → Loss: {loss:.4e}")

# 🔮 STEP 6: Make a prediction after training
# Now the model has learned — we can test it by giving it a new x-value.

# We use torch.no_grad() to tell PyTorch:
#   - We're done training
#   - Don't calculate gradients anymore
#   - Save memory and speed up prediction
with torch.no_grad():
    # Predict y for x = 10
    prediction = model(torch.tensor([[10.0]], dtype=torch.float32))
    print(f"\nPrediction for x=10.0: {prediction.item():.4f}")

# 📢 STEP 7: View what the model actually learned
# The model has internal values: weight and bias. Let's extract them.

# model[0] refers to the first (and only) layer — our linear layer
linear = model[0]

# The learned weight and bias are stored in the layer's parameters
weight = linear.weight.item()
bias = linear.bias.item()

# Print the final learned formula
# If everything worked, it should be very close to: y = 2x + 1
print(f"Learned formula: y = {weight:.4f} * x + {bias:.4f}")
